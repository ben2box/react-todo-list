# What is this?

My first React project, as part of a 6 week lab. A TODO List is a go-to project for most beginner devs and I guess I'm no different in that regard.
Developed from scratch by me, focused on the frontend (persistence was not part of the plan).

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
